# Active Transport Modelling Group at RMIT University

## About Us

We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers, transport modellers, spatial data scientists, and urban planners committed to improving urban mobility and promoting cycling as a viable and sustainable mode of transport.

## Our Research

Our research encompasses a wide range of topics related to active transport, with a particular focus on:
- **Agent-Based Modelling**: Developing detailed simulations of cyclist behavior and interactions within urban environments.
- **Infrastructure Impact Analysis**: Assessing how different types of cycling infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes) impact cyclist safety and mobility.
- **Policy Development Support**: Providing evidence-based recommendations to support the development of cycling-friendly policies and practices.
- **Sustainable Urban Mobility**: Exploring the role of cycling in promoting sustainable urban mobility and reducing carbon footprints.
